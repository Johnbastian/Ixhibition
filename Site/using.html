        <p>
            Firstly, before instantiating the library in javascript, a <tt>&#60;div&#62;</tt> tag
            with an ID must be created for the library to use. By default, the library looks for a
            <tt>&#60;div&#62;</tt> tag with the ID <em>"ixhibition"</em>, however another ID value
            can be used as long as it is passed when the library is instantiated. The <tt>&#60;div&#62;</tt>
            tag used <b>must</b> have a <tt>height</tt> and <tt>width</tt> set (which are in effect), with
            other attributes being optional, such as <tt>border</tt> and <tt>background-color</tt>.
            <br/>
            Instantiation will populate the assigned div tag, and will append <tt>&#60;style&#62;</tt> tags to
            the head in which the associated CSS will be injected in, including the animations.
