        <p>
            The development of packages atop of Ixhibition is encouraged, especially packages
            that add more  animation sets and ones that provide additional functionality.
            However, in an attempt to streamline and standardise this such that multiple packages
            could be used in any given project, a set of guidelines are provided.
        </p>

        <span class="spanTitle">General Guidelines</span>
        <p>
            These guidelines apply to all packages:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The package should request for an instance of ixhibition to be passed in as the
                    parameter when the package is instantiated. E.g.
<div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>
var ixb = Ixhibition();

//Do either:
MyPackage(ixb); //Useful for packages only dealing with simple animation options
//Or
var mypackage = MyPackage(ixb); //Used for all other types of packages
</code></pre></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                     It is not advised to modify the Ixhibition object itself, including adding more
                     functions, changing functions, and deleting functions. Ixhibition has been
                     developed in an encapsulated and self-contained format, and therefore any
                     modification to the object may have unintended consequences. The only form of
                     acceptable interaction is through the provided functions from the object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is strongly recommended to provide documentation for the package if the package is
                    intended to be for public use (should go without saying).
                </li>

            </ol>
        </p>

        <span class="spanTitle">Animation-oriented Package Guidelines</span>
        <p>
            Packages that only provide additional animation sets should follow these requirements:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In order to avoid conflict, the keynames for the animations provided by the
                    package should start with the package name or abbreviation, followed by an
                    underscore, and finally followed by the preset name,
                    i.e. <em>{package name}</em>__<em>{preset name}</em>
                    <br/> An example would be if the package is called <em>MyAnimation</em>, then the
                    keynames would follow these patterns: myanimation_[preset name] or ma_[preset name]
                    <br /> e.g. myanimation_1 or ma_1
<div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>
ixb.saveOption("ma_1", function(data){

    var settingsX = {
        "segueType" : "vertical",
        "phaseInDuration" : 2,
        "phaseInAnimations" : [
            {"transform" : "scale(0.7, 0.7)"},
            {"transform" : "scale(0.7, 0.7)"},
            {"transform" : "scale(1, 1)"}
        ],
        "phaseOutDuration" : 2,
        "phaseOutAnimations" : [
            {"transform" : "scale(1.05, 1.05)"},
            {"transform" : "scale(0.7, 0.7)"},
            {"transform" : "scale(0.7, 0.7)"}
        ],
        "phaseOverlap" : 1,
        "segueDuration" : "overlap",
    };

    return settingsX;

});
</code></pre></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                     When using preset options, due to possible additional calculations required within
                     the preset based of the <span class="codeBlock">data</span> object provided
                     <a class="codeBlock" href="https://github.com/Johnbastian/Ixhibition#saving">
                         see Saving
                     </a>,
                     it may be  neccessary for the <span class="codeBlock">loadOption(keyname)</span>
                     function to be executed relatively last; i.e. after setting
                     <span class="codeBlock">setDisplayDuration(displayDuration)</span>,
                     <span class="codeBlock">setPhaseIn(pIn_duration, pIn_animation)</span>,
                     <span class="codeBlock">setPhaseOut(pOut_duration, pOut_animation)</span>, and/or
                     <span class="codeBlock">setPhaseOverlap(poDuration)</span>. Therefore, if dependant
                     on any of the values provided by the <span class="codeBlock">data</span> object, then
                     it will be necessary to explain this within the package documentation or preferably
                     provide functions from the package object which take into account and deal with
                     these attributes.
                </li>

            </ol>
        </p>

        <span class="spanTitle">Functionality-oriented (and other) Package Guidelines</span>
        <p>
            Packages that only provide additional animation sets should follow these requirements:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    It is recommended that the package (object) is encapsulated and self-contained (similar
                    to Ixhibition), and provides (public) functions in order to perform various tasks. This
                    is not only to regulate name-space,  but also to retain and maintain control within the
                    package itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The package may be dependent on other APIs and/or Libraries, and therefore this should
                    be made clear within the package documentation, and possibly resolve the dependancies
                    itself by appending the required scripts to the DOM upon package instantiation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Animations should follow the <em>Animation-oriented Package Guidelines</em> and provide
                    (public) functions regardlessly.
                </li>

            </ol>
