        Ixhibition is an image gallery generated in Javascript and powered by CSS3 Animations,
        with the additional advantage of modifying animations using CSS3 Animation supported
        attributes. Ixhibition is also intended to serve as a core library on which additional
        packages may be developed, for additional and/or specific functionality, including
        providing a more animation sets and for connecting to other APIs and libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ixhibition has been developed with the goal of reducing as much Javascript interaction as
        possible. What is meant by this is that while JS is used to instantiate and generate the
        gallery (HTML and CSS), JS is meant to play no role after loading it into the DOM: all
        animation and transitioning is governed by CSS3 animations only. Therefore, once the gallery
        has been loaded into the DOM, Ixhibition will not be performing and executing any further JS
        unless invoked by a public function.
    </p>

        Ixhibition was developed and maintained by Johnbastian Emilianus. <br />
        Ixhibition is 100% open source.
